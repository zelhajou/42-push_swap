# push_swap

The "push_swap" project at 42 is a programming challenge that involves sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions. The goal is to develop an efficient algorithm that can transform an unsorted stack into a sorted one, using only a predefined set of operations like pushing and swapping elements between two stacks. It's a test of both algorithmic problem-solving and coding skills.
