# push swap

## Overview

The "push_swap" project at 42 is a programming challenge that involves sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions. The goal is to develop an efficient algorithm that can transform an unsorted stack into a sorted one, using only a predefined set of operations like pushing and swapping elements between two stacks. It's a test of both algorithmic problem-solving and coding skills.

## The rules

- You have 2 stacks named `a` and `b`.
- At the beginning:
   - The stack `a` contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated.
   - The stack `b` is empty.
- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:

## Features

- Sorts a stack of integers using push and swap operations.
- Implements an optimized sorting algorithm.
- Provides detailed instructions on running the program and testing.
- Offers a clear and well-structured codebase for easy understanding and modification.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Push Swap project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/push-swap.git
   ```
2. Compile the project:

```bash
make
```

3. Run the program with your input:

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1
```

4. Test the program:
```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1 | ./checker 3 2 1
````

##  Usage
Replace `3` `2` `1` with your own input numbers for testing.
View the detailed usage instructions and available options in the project documentation.
